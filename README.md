## Big warning!
Somehow the software is since today treated as `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml` by Windows Defender. Now with any release I publish will come a VirusTotal link. Again, **you shouldn't trust me. If you don't, build an app yourself.**

## Usage
1. Get the `.exe` binary (build the code or download from [releases](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases))
2. If you have a steam version of the game, steam client should be running.
3. Run the app.
4. If you don't have a steam copy of the game, start Muse Dash when required.
5. Wait for the app to patch Muse Dash. It'll be closed automatically.
