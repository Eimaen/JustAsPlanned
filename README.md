## Installation
**Warning:** As the app contains byte arrays, Defender *sometimes* deletes built binaries. Please exclude the binaries in Windows Defender settings. **You shouldn't trust me. If you don't, build an app yourself.**

### Downloading prebuilt binaries
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases) page and download latest version.
2. Open it (Steam has to be running too).

### DIY guide
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open it with Visual Studio.
3. Build the project and run.

## Usage
1. Get the `.exe` binary (compile the code or download from [releases](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases))
2. If you have a steam version of the game, steam client should be running.
3. Run the app.
4. If you don't have a steam copy of the game, start Muse Dash when required.
5. Wait for the app to patch Muse Dash. It'll be closed automatically.
