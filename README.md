## Big warning!
Somehow the software is since 01.05.2023 treated as `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml` by Windows Defender. Now with any release I publish will come a VirusTotal link. Again, **you shouldn't trust me. If you don't, build an app yourself.** If you trust VirusTotal, consider using [this release](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases/tag/1.0.2.1) ([VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f9b8cc83ba3db744281c4e814ebd2822ba59b9f5af1a48af54785ca155791fb6)), it has no Touhou backgrounds or fancy UI, but works and is only detected by 3 AV solutions.

UPD: The results of the latest release analysis are here:

## Usage
1. Get the `.exe` binary (build the code or download from [releases](https://github.com/Eimaen/JustAsPlanned/releases))
2. If you have a steam version of the game, steam client should be running.
3. Run the app.
4. If you don't have a steam copy of the game, start Muse Dash when required.
5. Wait for the app to patch Muse Dash. It'll be closed automatically.
